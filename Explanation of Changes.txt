Zombie Script____________

1)added GetClosestTarget()

 Made it so the zombies will target the closest player and chase him. Helps us for
when we have more than one player on the screen. 
**NOTE** all players must have the “Player” tag

2)added CanIBite()

uses the target that it is following from GetClosestTarget(), and if it is close enough will deal damage to the player character.

3) updated FixedUpdate()

updated it to fit these changes


PlayerController Script________

1) added TakeDamage(){

gets damage from an outside source and apples it to a new health int variable
**NOTE** the only thing i did was make blood, from Zombie script. Wasn’t sure how we want our player to die and if we have a player dead animation.

2) changed the melee key

changed the melee key from mouse button two to the ‘r’ key.
