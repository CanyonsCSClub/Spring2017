When you first open this project in unity the first thing you should do
is create a new scene. 
If you are unfimilair with unity here's how:

Any changes you make or object you create will go in this scene.
Reason why we do this is so that merging on the github side is alot easier.

Also another note:
If you are coding in an existing script make sure that you do note delete
the original owners code. COMMENT IT OUT. In the real world doing this can get you in a lot of 
trouble. Make sure to also comment any lines you add as well.

If you are making a new script:
here's how:
  https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CreatingAndUsingScripts.html
please make sure to somment your code at least a little bit so that
others can follow if they edit it later.

So what next: 
go on github and create your own branch. This is were you will submit all your code.

then, start coding and start creating. good luck y'all - Chris
